flow-time: {
  look: im flowing!,
  sweet: noice,
  plus: [
    i can do,
    this!,
  ],
}
does this: "work?"
how:
  about:
    this: 4
ok:
  how about: {
  this: "huh?",
  because: "it's misaligned"
}
  and then: does this work
  but...: will it
pop out: "?"
try the complex keys:
  ? - hi: how
    - are: 'you?'
  : 'good and you?'
  ? ok lets try
  : this
  ? {

here's a literal block: |
  foo
  bar
    cars are cool
  yeah they are
explicit indent: |1
  there's an extra space at the beginning
  this is the simple test case
deep:
  explicit:
    indent:
      test: |1
        how many spaces

         are
       on this one?
       idk
         maybe a hundred?
folding test: >
  these two lines
  are folded together

  this, however, is on a separate line

  these indented lines are preserved:
    * cool
    * beans
    * my dude
  this is on its own line
