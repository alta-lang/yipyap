    hi there
    wassup
     one space
      two space
       three space
        four
       three again
    none!
flow-time: {
  look: im flowing!,
  sweet: noice,
  plus: [
    i can do,
    this!,
  ],
}
does this: "work?"
how:
  about:
    this: 4
ok:
  how about: {
  this: "huh?",
  because: "it's misaligned"
}
  and then: does this work
  but...: will it
pop out: "?"
try the complex keys:
  ? - hi: how
    - are: 'you?'
  : 'good and you?'
  ? ok lets try
  : this
  ? {
    will: flow,
    style nodes: 'work?',
  }
  : definitely maybe yes
some: random # comment here!
it just: needs a #space before it
however: this#is not a comment
is this: -1 # interpreted correctly?
here's a literal block: |
  foo
  bar
    cars are cool
  yeah they are
explicit indent: |1
  there's an extra space at the beginning
  this is the simple test case
deep:
  explicit:
    indent:
      test: |1
        how many spaces

         are
       on this one?
       idk
         maybe a hundred?
folding test: >
  these two lines
  are folded together

  this, however, is on a separate line

  these indented lines are preserved:
    * cool
    * beans
    * my dude
  this is on its own line


keep extra spaces at the end: |+
  foo
  bar



no final spaces: >-
  does it
  work like
  this

  maybe...

cool: 5

plain block scalar:
  here's a thing
  and it should work
and then: after?
what about: this and
  it continues

  what about with newlines
  huh? does it work?
and after: wards?

tag time!: !my-greeting bonjour

? !my-cool-key-type my cool key!
: awesome key, bro

pointy: &thing this is basically a pointer like in C
? *thing
: it can be used as a key

these should be null:
  - null
  - Null
  - NULL
  - ~
  -

these should be floats:
  - 3.14 # first three digits of Pi
  - 2.718 # first four digits of Euler's number (e)
  - 3e4 # 3*10**4 = 30000
  - 3.14e-2 # 3.14*10**-2 = 0.0314
  - .489

this should NOT be parsed: !!str 4
?
: this has a null complex key
this has a null value:
this thing: {
  has some null entries: ,
  : this has a null key,
}
